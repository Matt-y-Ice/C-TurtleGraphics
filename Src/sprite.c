/*
 * File: sprite.c
 *
 * Description:
 * This file contains the functions responsible for updating and controlling the sprite's behavior
 * in the Interactive Turtle Graphics program. The main operations involve handling the sprite's
 * movement, rotation, pen state (up or down), and color changes. The sprite represents the "turtle"
 * that draws lines based on user input. It interacts with OpenGL for rendering and responds to SDL events
 * to update its position and properties in real-time.
 *
 * Functions:
 *    - update_location: Calculates and updates the sprite's position based on its current angle and speed,
 *      while ensuring the sprite stays within the window boundaries.
 *    - update_pen: Updates the pen state of the sprite (pen up or pen down), determining whether it draws
 *      lines as it moves.
 *    - change_color: Changes the color of the turtle's pen based on user input. Different integer options
 *      correspond to different colors.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *    - sprite.h: Contains the declaration of the Sprite structure and related functions.
 *    - math.h: For trigonometric calculations to update the sprite's movement.
 *    - stdio.h: For input/output operations, including error reporting.
 *
 * This file allows the main application to control the movement, drawing, and appearance of the sprite,
 * enabling interactive graphics where users can create drawings by controlling the turtle.

void update_location(const float deltaTime, const int windowWidth, const int windowHeight) {
/*
 * handle_events - Processes SDL events and updates the game state based on user input.
 *
 * This function is responsible for handling various SDL events, such as key presses, key releases,
 * window resizing, and other events. It updates the game state accordingly, such as moving the sprite,
 * rotating it, or changing the pen state. The function also manages window resizing by adjusting the
 * OpenGL viewport and projection. It handles both key press (SDL_KEYDOWN) and key release (SDL_KEYUP)
 * events to control the turtleâ€™s movement and other actions. Additionally, it returns a boolean value
 * indicating whether the main game loop should continue running or exit.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    deltaTime    - The time difference between the current and the previous frame, used to ensure
 *                   smooth and frame-independent movement.
 *    windowWidth  - Pointer to the width of the window. This is updated in case of a window resize.
 *    windowHeight - Pointer to the height of the window. This is updated in case of a window resize.
 *
 * Returns:
 *    true if the game loop should continue, false if the game loop should exit (e.g., on quitting or
 *    pressing the ESC key).

 * drawing lines as it moves. When the pen is down (`pen_state` is true), the turtle will draw lines,
 * and when the pen is up (`pen_state` is false), the turtle will not draw lines.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    pen_state - A boolean value indicating the desired state of the pen.
 *                true means the pen is down (drawing), false means the pen is up (not drawing).

 * If an invalid color option is provided, an error message is printed. The available colors are:
 *    1 - Black
